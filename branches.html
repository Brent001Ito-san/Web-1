    <h1  ><span style="background-color:rgb(104, 189, 20);"> The Cape County Resort - Cape Town, South Africa</span></h1>
    <p>
        County Resort is the only luxury Cape Town hotel located within Table Mountain National Park: <br>
        at the base of precipitous Chapman’s Peak, it is also the only hotel in the city that is right on the <br>
        beach and offers sublime ocean views, excellent food and authentic, warm service.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><b>Facilities </b></h3>
    <p>
        Fancy a day flopped by the pool? Grab your pool bag from the closet and get settled in; there’s <br>
        even sunscreen and water to be sourced from the woven bags dotted around the terrace. For those <br>
        with a little more motivation, there’s Virgin Active gym passes on offer from reception, who are<br>
        on-hand 24 hours a day - it’s rather like having a brilliant concierge service. 
    </p>
    <h3><b>Food and drink</b></h3>
    <p>
        The breakfast at County Resort is quite possibly the best start to the day you might ever have. <br>
        Lavish (go for at least two courses), and also included in your room rate, it's served at any time<br>
        of day, and if you’re feeling particularly lazy (or are still recovering from a Table Mountain <br>
        hike),  they’re also happy to bring it to your room. There’s a full bar service, including a cocktail <br>
        list and wine list, as well as a limited but seasonally based menu. 
    </p>
    <h3><b>Extra-Curricular </b></h3>
    <p>
        County Resort is ideally placed if you want to hit one of the Table Mountain trails early doors, <br>
        but make sure you keep an eye on the weather: brisk south-easterly winds often usher in a fog-<br>
        like blanket, the ‘tablecloth’ that settles along the flat top, and shuts down the cable car that also <br>
        shuttles people up and down. Sunrise hikes along Lion’s Head, which sits next to Table <br>
        Mountain with views down the Atlantic Seaboard, are ‘a must’, according to locals.
